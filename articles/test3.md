# Redot 4.4 Beta Release!

Weâ€™re thrilled to announce the release of the beta version 4.4 of our game engine, Redot!

This version features a rebranding and introduces a new Preview Environment with an updated default color scheme and a new horizon color option (see screenshot below for an example).

Important Note: Currently, we do not have a Mac build available as we are still in the process of obtaining a Mac developer account certificate. We appreciate your understanding as we work towards this.

While our website is still in the works, you can access the beta build through the following link to our repository's release section: Download Redot 4.4 Beta

Main Repo: https://github.com/Redot-Engine/redot-engine
Release Page: https://github.com/Redot-Engine/redot-engine/releases/tag/2024101114

Thank you for your patience and support! We look forward to sharing more updates about the engine and other community announcements soon.

Please note we are working on streamlining the download process as you read this.
